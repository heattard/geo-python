## The assignment
For this _Final Project_ you will be creating a 2 panel plot for your assigned SSW. 

### Panel 1

The first panel will have the **climatological mean** 10 hPa nad 60N zonal-mean zonal wind for November - March **and** the 10 hPa 60 N zonal-mean zonal wind for the same period for _your SSW_. 

### Panel 2
The second panel, which can either be next to the first panel, or below it, will show the same variables but for the _4 week period_ that is +/- 2 weeks of the SSW onset date. 

### Requirements

#### Panel 1
1. Title that has the years included in the figure (i.e., 2007-2008)
2. labeled x and y axes
3. a box around the +/- 2 week period of the SSW
4. A thin line on the date of the SSW

#### Panel 2
1. Title that has the start and end date of the period
2. labeled x and y axes
3. A line on the start date of the SSW

>Note that the two panels **do not** need to have the same y axes.
>If you think that your Panel 2 (the zoom in version) should be over a different time period (e.g., +/- 3 weeks) because it shows the evoluation of the wind better, go ahead!

#### The data
- The climotologlical mean data is in `/data/merra2/climo/u10hPa60N_climo.csv`
- The daily data for all years is in `/data/merra2/u_10hPa_60N.csv`
